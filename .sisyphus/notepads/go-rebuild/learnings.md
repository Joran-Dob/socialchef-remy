# Project Initialization
- Initialized Go module `github.com/socialchef/remy`.
- Set up standard Go project layout: `cmd/` for entrypoints, `internal/` for private packages.
- Created `Makefile` with standard targets for build, test, and docker operations.
- Go was not initially installed in the environment; installed via `brew install go`.
